# glx-cpp-example-cube

Example OpenGL Project using OpenGL GLX drawing methods to render a spining cube. [Linux Only]

This project is about testing OpenGL compatibility on linux OSes and old GPUs. 
No external third party library is required since the project is using the X window system and by extension, GLX to create the OpenGL context.
The compiled binary(ies) could be found in the "builds" folder and it's sources could be found in the "src" one.
To Compile it manualy, it is entended to run the "compile.sh" bash script if g++ is installed.
The actual code found in "/src/screen.h" could be found at the following web address. Though, it has been slightly edited to ensure multiple script compatibility.
